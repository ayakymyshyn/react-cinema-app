                    Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime
                    is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the
                    secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers
                    on Earth. Now it's up to the unlikely alliance of inventor
                    Cade Yeager, Bumblebee, a n English lord and an Oxford
                    professor to save the world. Transformers: The Last Knight
                    has a deeper mythos and bigger spectacle than its
                    predecessors, yet still ends up being mostly hollow and
                    cacophonous. The first "Transformers" movie that could
                    actually be characterized as badass. Which isn't a bad
                    thing. It may, in fact, be better.
